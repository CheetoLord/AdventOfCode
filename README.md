## My Advent Of Code Solutions
I had hoped to put up my solutions from all the years I have done, but unfortunately, this has not panned out. I have lost access to the service I once used to do this, so I no longer have access to all of those files. All I have is some amateur solutions from when I was 15. (I didnt even know the difference between a char and a string in c++ back then, just check out what I did in line 21 of day-1/part1.cpp XD)
Anyways, here is some evidence I have done more and even completed a handful of years.
